[mod-setting-description]
ltn-interface-console-level=Detail level of in game messages.\n\n0: Off\nNo messages will be generated.\n\n1: Errors & Warnings\nPrint only errors and warnings.\n\n2: Notifications (default)\nPrint basic information like missing resources or generating deliveries.\n\n3: Detailed Messages\nPrint detailed information about finding providers and trains.
ltn-interface-factorio-alerts=Show errors and warnings as Factorio alerts
ltn-interface-debug-logfile=Write debug information to /Factorio/factorio-current.log.
ltn-dispatcher-enabled=Warning: Deactivating Dispatcher stops delivery generation.\nItem levels will still be monitored.
ltn-dispatcher-nth_tick=How fast stops and requests are updated.\nHigher numbers improve performance by spreading out updates over more ticks.\nWhen set > 1 forces Updates per tick to 1.
ltn-dispatcher-updates-per-tick=Limits the number of stops and requests updated per tick.\nLower numbers increase performance.\nIgnored when Update frequency > 1.
ltn-dispatcher-requester-threshold=Missing amount of items/fluids triggering a delivery.\nCan be overridden with signal at requesting stops.\ndefault = 1000
ltn-dispatcher-provider-threshold=Amount of items/fluids required to act as provider.\nCan be overridden with signal at providing stops.\ndefault = 1000
ltn-dispatcher-schedule-circuit-control=Adds circuit conditions to wait for red = 0 OR green ≥ 1 to all stops.\nWarning: All LTN stops require having "send to train" enabled and a circuit connection. Otherwise trains will be stuck waiting forever.\ndefault = false
ltn-dispatcher-depot-inactivity=Duration in seconds of inactivity before trains leave the depot.\ndefault = 5
ltn-dispatcher-stop-timeout=Duration in seconds before trains are forced out of a station.\n0 deactivates this feature.\ndefault = 120
ltn-dispatcher-delivery-timeout=Duration in seconds deliveries can take before assuming the train was lost.\ndefault = 600 (10min)
ltn-dispatcher-requester-delivery-reset=False (default):\nDelivery and schedule are reset when train arrives at depot.\nChanges to trains parked at requesting stops have no effect.\n\nTrue:\nDelivery and schedule are reset when train leaves requester.\nChanges to trains parked at requesting stops will remove delivery and reset schedule.
ltn-dispatcher-finish-loading=True (default):\nPrevents trains from leaving while inserters/pumps are working by adding 2s inactivity condition.\n\nFalse:\nTrains will leave immediately when all items have been loaded.\nInserters at loading stations will get stuck.
ltn-depot-reset-filters=True (default):\nCargo wagons have their filters and stack limitations cleared when entering a depot.
ltn-depot-fluid-cleaning=Maximum amount of fluid per wagon automatically destroyed when entering depots.\nSet to 0 to disable or -1 to remove everything.
ltn-stop-default-network=Network ID used for stops without "Encoded Network ID" signal.
ltn-provider-show-existing-cargo=True(default):\nCargo inside train when arriving at provider is shown in LTN Output.\nIncludes items from inserters holding items on tracks.
ltn-provider-ignore-stopped-train=True (default):\nIgnore a stopped train at the requester stop when calculating shipment to the requester.
ltn-schedule-fuel-station=Enable refueling trains at fuel stations.\nSends trains for refueling if they are low on fuel and a fuel station is in its current network.
ltn-schedule-reset-interrupts=Remove all Train schedule interrupts when reaching a depot.
ltn-schedule-reselect-depot=(This setting has no effect if "Delivery completes at requester" is false). If enabled, reselect the depot that the train will go to.
ltn-fuel-station-interrupt=When set, use a Factorio train interrupt to send a train for refueling. This is the default and should only be changed if the interrupt causes problems. When unset, LTN will dynamically alter the schedule of a train to send them for refueling. This requires more cycles but can control refueling better (e.g. it will not send the train for refueling when arriving at a temporary stop).
ltn-advanced-cross-surface-delivery=When set, LTN will choose trains from different surfaces to execute deliveries or send trains to other surfaces first to pick up deliveries. Do not turn on unless your network stretches across multiple surfaces and is connected (e.g. by the Space Exploration Space Elevator).
ltn-depot-fudge-factor=Largest difference in distance between depot and provider that is considered equal when selecting a free train.
